      This is you creating your own interview form.  Be creative.
      Use Bootstrap and also create your own style classes if needed. 
      This will be a vertically stacked tab format containing options for "Contact Info", "Favorite Music", "Dev Skills", and you create the last tab category. (see my screenshot for an example)
    </div>
    <div class="tab-content">
    	For each tab it should switch to the active tab and display content.  Include features such as dropdown menu, radio buttons, etc.  Typical form items.  Bonus points for styling form items.  All forms should include some kind of validation (ex. contact info.number input can only be numbers).   
    </div>
    <div class="horizontal-tabs">
    	Create a 2 tab horizontal setup with lorem ipsum content for both tabs.
    </div>

    	This is not meant to be a hard test - I know you guys know how to code.  Just want to see where you are at the moment.  Thanks, and any questions, ping me.  -Andrew
